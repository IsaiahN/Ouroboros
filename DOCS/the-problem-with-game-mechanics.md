The problem with locksmith and some of the other ARC 3 AGI games is super clear now. You've abstracted concepts from the real world (game lives, little squares to denote actions left) and we humans understand this from gameplay and society, but an agent that was "born" into this game world only, and has no outside understanding is left to the level of the understanding of the programmer (plato's allegory of the cave).

My model has been stuck on locksmith for ages, because i suck at iq games, and my understanding of the action system was fundamentally flawed -> agents have incomplete knowledge on all the ways that actions can be used.

Now that i have that understanding, I can give them the ruleset on (not how to beat this game - would be useless longterm) but how to move about the board and observe the board (the world model / self model) and then they can use that to form the theories on the winning conditions for each level.

The way i was building my model was that everything they learned about actions came from the ARC 3 API DOCs but your documentation is not sufficient. Which means agents cannot be trained from scratch (without outside knowledge) and make it to the later levels.

The only agents capable of beating these game levels are 1) the agents that brute forced their understanding, and then reverse engineered the sequence, and even those might not understand the rules of the game they are playing.

2) the LLM powered agents (using chatgpt, gemini, etc) because LLM have alot of out of game context about human culture like the concept of game lives, understanding of game mechanics, and are multimodal so they can visualize the grid and would generally do alot better at game play than any thing someone could train from scratch.
